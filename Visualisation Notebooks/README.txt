1.DATASET

All of my datasets update daily by importing the URL from the RAW dataset on github.
Therefore I have no submitted any datasets as it will take them from online in their current state,
as long as you are connected to the internet.

2.NOTEBOOKS

For my notebooks I have three for each week corresponding to the three different datasets we used.
One for Cases,Deaths and Recoveries.
So in total I have nine notebooks.
To make it easier to get through I have explained most of my code in the Confirmed Cases notebooks.
Which means there are less makrdown cells on in my other two for each week as the concepts 
explained in confirmed cases are repeated in them.

To run my code start from the first cell, and run each cell chronologically.
By the end of the notebook a graph similar to the ones in my presentation should appear.

3.DEPENDENCIES.
For my WEEK 3 graphs I included a mathplotlib dependency called ticker 
i.e. import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
I used this to set my ticks before I discovered how to use .get_xticks and .set_xticks.

Thank you for taking the time to read and run my notebooks.
